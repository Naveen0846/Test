->SQl Introduction:

SQL is Structured Query Language, which is a programming language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data stored in a relational database.

SQL is the standard language for Relational Database System.
 All the Relational Database Management Systems (RDMS) like MySQL, MS Access, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres and SQL Server use SQL as their standard database language.

->SQL commands:

The standard SQL commands to interact with relational databases are CREATE, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE and DROP. These commands can be classified into the following groups based on their nature,
1)DDL - Data Definition Language

DDL is short name of Data Definition Language, 
which deals with database schemas and descriptions, of how the data should reside in the database.

    CREATE - create a new table, view for a table or other object in the database
    ALTER - modifies an existing database object, such as a table
    DROP - deletes an entire table, a view of a table or other objects in the database
    TRUNCATE - remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed
    COMMENT - add comments to the data dictionary
    RENAME - rename an object

 
2)DML - Data Manipulation Language
DML is short name of Data Manipulation Language,
which deals with data manipulation and includes most common SQL statements such SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE etc, and it is used to store, modify, retrieve, delete and update data in a database.

    SELECT - retrieves records from one or more tables
    INSERT - creates a record
    UPDATE - modifies records
    DELETE - deletes records
    MERGE - UPSERT operation (insert or update)
    CALL - call a PL/SQL or Java subprogram
    EXPLAIN PLAN - interpretation of the data access path
    LOCK TABLE - concurrency control

 
3)DCL - Data Control Language
DCL is short name of Data Control Language,
which includes commands such as GRANT and mostly concerned with rights, permissions and other controls of the database system.

    GRANT (Grant privilige(s) to user)
    REVOKE (Remove granted privilige(s) from a user)

 
4)TCL - Transaction Control Language
TCL is short name of Transaction Control Language which deals with a transaction within a database.
    
	COMMIT - commits a transaction
    ROLLBACK - rollback a transaction in case of any error occurs
    SAVEPOINT - to rollback the transaction making points within groups
    SET TRANSACTION - specify characteristics of the transaction

->Table

Table is a collection of data, organized in terms of rows and columns. In DBMS term, table is known as relation and row as tuple.

1)Create Table Syntax
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    column3 datatype,
   ....
);

CREATE TABLE AS Statement

The CREATE TABLE AS statement is used to create a table from an existing table by copying the columns of existing table.
syntax:
CREATE TABLE new_table  
  AS (SELECT column_1, column2, ... column_n  
      FROM old_table);  

a)ALTER TABLE Statement
In Oracle, ALTER TABLE statement specifies how to add, modify, drop or delete columns in a table. 
It is also used to rename a table.

b)How to add column in a table?
ALTER TABLE table_name  
  ADD column_name column-definition;

c)How to modify column of a table?
ALTER TABLE table_name  
  MODIFY column_name column_type;

d)How to drop column of a table?
ALTER TABLE table_name  
  DROP COLUMN column_name;  

e)How to rename column of a table?
ALTER TABLE table_name  
 RENAME COLUMN old_name to new_name;  

f)How to rename table?
ALTER TABLE table_name  
  RENAME TO new_table_name; 

g)Drop table?
Oracle DROP TABLE statement is used to remove or delete a table from the Oracle database.

Syntax
DROP [schema_name].TABLE table_name  
[ CASCADE CONSTRAINTS ]  
[ PURGE ];


2)Data Types

SQL Data Types
Data types are used to represent the nature of the data that can be stored in the database table. For example, in a particular column of a table, if we want to store a string type of data then we will have to declare a string data type of this column.
Data types mainly classified into three categories for every database.
o	String Data types
o	Numeric Data types
o	Date and time Data types

Insert Data in Table:
SQL INSERT statement is a SQL query. It is used to insert a single or a multiple records in a table.
There are two ways to insert data in a table:

Syntax

In the first method there is no need to specify the column name where the data will be inserted, you need only their values.
INSERT INTO table_name  VALUES (value1, value2, value3....);  

The second method specifies both the column name and values which you want to insert.
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3....)  VALUES (value1, value2, value3.....);  

Update Statement

Syntax
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ... 
WHERE condition;


Delete table

In Oracle, DELETE statement is used to remove or delete a single record or multiple records from a table.

Syntax 
DELETE FROM table_name  
WHERE conditions;  

Order By

ORDER BY clause to sort the result set by one or more columns in ascending or descending order.
Syntax
SELECT
    column_1,
    column_2,
    column_3,
    ...
FROM
    table_name
ORDER BY
    column_1 [ASC | DESC] [NULLS FIRST | NULLS LAST],
    column_1 [ASC | DESC] [NULLS FIRST | NULLS LAST],
    ...

Eg:
select * from emp order by Gender desc;

Group By

In Oracle GROUP BY clause is used with SELECT statement to collect data from multiple records and group the results by one or more columns.

Syntax
SELECT expression1, expression2, ... expression_n,   
aggregate_function (aggregate_expression)  
FROM tables  
WHERE conditions  
GROUP BY expression1, expression2, ... expression_n;

Oracle SELECT DISTINCT
SELECT DISTINCT statement to query distinct data from tables.

Syntax
SELECT DISTINCT column_1
FROM table;

AND Operator

AND operator to combine two or more Boolean expressions.

The AND operator is a logical operator that combines Boolean expressions and returns true if both expressions are true. If one of the expressions is false, the AND operator returns false.

Syntax
expression_1 AND expression_2

Oracle OR operator

The OR operator is a logical operator that combines Boolean expressions and returns true if one of the expressions is true.

The following illustrates the syntax of the OR operator:

expression_1 AND expression_2
Code language: SQL (Structured Query Language) (sql)
The following table shows the results the OR operator between true, false, and a NULL value.

	TRUE	FALSE	NULL
TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE
FALSE	TRUE	FALSE	NULL
NULL	TRUE	NULL	NULL


Oracle FETCH clause

Oracle FETCH clause to limit the rows returned by a query.
Syntax

[ OFFSET offset ROWS]
 FETCH  NEXT [  row_count | percent PERCENT  ] ROWS  [ ONLY | WITH TIES ]

Oracle BETWEEN

The BETWEEN operator allows you to specify a range to test. When you use the BETWEEN operator to form a search condition for rows returned by a SELECT statement, only rows whose values are in the specified range are returned.

Syntax
expression [ NOT ] BETWEEN low AND high

EG :
select * from emp where year between 1988 and 2002 order by year asc;

Oracle IN Operator

IN operator to determine whether a value matches any value in a list or a subquery.
Syntax 
expression [NOT] IN (v1,v2,...)

SQL Aggregate Functions

An aggregate function performs a calculation on a set of values, and returns a single value. Except for COUNT(*), aggregate functions ignore null values. Aggregate functions are often used with the GROUP BY clause of the SELECT statement.

COUNT() Syntax
SELECT COUNT(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

AVG() Syntax

SELECT AVG(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

SUM() Syntax

SELECT SUM(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
